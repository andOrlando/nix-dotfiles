## My nix dotfiles

they're so cool

to get it started put it in `/etc/nixos`, run `rebuild.sh` in `projects/rebuild`, which from then on will just be `rebuild` in path

you also need to enable flakes somehow idk how just do it lol

you also prolly wanna `chmod -R o+w /etc/nixos` so you can easily edit config
